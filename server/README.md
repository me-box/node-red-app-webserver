node-red-app-webserver
----------------------

This is the code that is bundled into a databox app alongside an instance of the node-red executuon environment.  Node-red communicates with this container's server, which then sends data over websockets to the client.  It looks similar to the databox-test-app which is used to TEST apps with the SDK.
